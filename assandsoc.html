									<p>Associations and Societies consist of groups of people from the same profession, who gather together for networking events and to improve the standards for the profession. Students who have just graduated and entered the field are able to network with professionals, and are praised for learning more about their field of interest. Associations provide job listings, certification classes, case studies, and journal and magazine access. Members of professional associations are student-friendly and want to mentor incoming workers as they transition to the corporate world. Associations and societies can be state-wide, nation-wide, or international. </p>
